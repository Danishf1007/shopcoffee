    <h3>Why people love to drink coffee?</h3>
    <p>In the short term, caffeine can boost the metabolic rate and increase fat burning, but after a while people become tolerant to the effects and it stops working. 
        But even if coffee doesn't make you expend more calories in the long term, there is still a possibility that it blunts appetite and helps you eat less.</p>
    <p>Coffee contains caffeine, a central nervous system stimulant that is known for its ability to fight fatigue and increase energy levels </p>
    <h3>Why we different with other</h3>
    <p>Sourced from the finest coffee-growing regions: We source our coffee beans from the world's most renowned coffee-growing regions, including Ethiopia, Colombia, and Brazil.
        This ensures that our beans are of the highest quality and have a distinct flavor profile.
        Commitment to sustainability: We are committed to sustainable coffee farming practices and ethical sourcing.
         We work directly with coffee farmers to ensure that they receive fair compensation for their crops and that their farms are managed in a way that protects the environment.</p>
